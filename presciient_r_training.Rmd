This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

```{r}
# Run demo from packages if available
demo("graphics")

```
```{r}
# Run examples from R's online help topic
example("lm")
```
The following command will created a new tab in RStudio Server
```{r}
# List all functions in the package
library(help = "stats")
```

# Basic Input and Output

The following commands are used to change the working directories
```{r}
getwd()
setwd("/home/pkim/git")
getwd()
setwd("/home/pkim/git/r-play-area")
getwd()
```
This command lists the contents of the current working directory
```{r}
dir()
```
```{r}
df1 <- read.table(file="HR_comma_sep.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
df1
```
There are other variants of this function with differente defaults
```{r}
df1 <- read.csv(file="HR_comma_sep.csv")
df1
```
Read a file from a website usg 
```{r}
df2 <- read.table(file="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data",sep=",",header=FALSE)
df2
# Please note the V# columns if you don't specify row.names
```
Read from keyboard numeric values  
Type from console
```{r}
numvals <- scan(file="",what="numeric")
numvals
```
Read from keyboard characters
Type from console
```{r}
charvals <- scan(file="",what="character")
charvals
```
Write to a CSV file  
The double quote characters are used for each value so the filesize is different from the original file
```{r}
write.table(x=df1, file="mydataout.csv",sep=",",col.names=TRUE)
```
You can use specific csv writing functions
```{r}
write.table(x=df1, file="mydataout.csv")
```
# Vectors

```{r}
myvec.int <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
#myvec.int <- c(1,7:9)
myvec.int
myvec.char <- c("apple","dell","microsoft","ibm")
myvec.char
myvec.logical <- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)
myvec.logical
```
The mode function displays the storage mode of the object
```{r}
mode(myvec.logical)
```
The seq function and ":" operator to create a vector
```{r}
y <- 1:4
y
pi:10
10:pi
# "by" is to specify the increments
seq(from=2, to=8, by=2)
# "length" is to specify the resulting vector
seq(from=0, to=1, length=11)
```
The rep (repeat) function and replicates the elements of a vector (and list)
```{r}
# "times" specifies the number of repetitions
rep(x=c(1,2,3,4), times=2)
# "each" specifies the number of repetitions for each element of the vector
rep(x=c(1,2,3,4), each=2)
rep(x=1:4,each=4)
rep(x=1:4,times=4)
rep(x=1:4,times=1:4)
```
Vector Arithmetics
```{r}
c(1,2,3,4)/2
c(1,2,3,4)/c(4,3,2,1)
# the smaller vector is recycled so the result is 2/2,4/3,6/2,8/3
c(2,4,6,8)/c(2,3)
```
Basic Vector Functions
```{r}
vector.one <- 1:10
vector.one
length(vector.one)
sum(vector.one)
mean(vector.one)
median(vector.one)
```
Vector Manipulation
```{r}
myvec <- 2001:2100
# Index in R starts in 1 and NOT from 0
myvec[1]
length(myvec)
myvec[length(myvec)]

# You can name each element of a vector
newvec <- 1:5
names(newvec) <- c("one","two","three","four","five")
newvec
```
Vector Indexing
```{r}
# first 10 elements
myvec[1:10]
# all but first element
myvec[-1]
# all but second element
myvec[-2]
# all but first 10 elements
myvec[-(1:10)]
# a vector can be indexed by another vector
myvec[c(1,12,19,21,38,82,91)]
```
